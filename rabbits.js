   ARIZONA RABBITS — YOUR RABBIT LIST

   This is the ONLY file you edit day to day. Never touch index.html.

   These are your real rabbits, born 28 July 2026. Reservable now,
   ready to go home 22 September (the eight week mark).

   ── TO MARK ONE RESERVED ──
      change   status: "available"
      to       status: "reserved"

   ── TO MARK ONE SOLD ──
      change   status: "available"
      to       status: "adopted"
      and set  soldOn: "2026-08-20"      (today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
      It stays up as proof for 3 days, then disappears on its own.

   ── TO ADD A NEW RABBIT ──
      Copy any block between { and }, including the comma at the end,
      paste it in, and change the details.

   ── TO REMOVE ONE NOW ──
      Delete its whole block, from { to },

   ── RULES THE SITE HANDLES FOR YOU ──
      • Cards are sorted most expensive first, automatically. Don't
        reorder them yourself; the order in this file doesn't matter.
      • The "X of Y still available" counter updates itself.
      • Adopted rabbits vanish 3 days after their soldOn date.
      • Leave photo: "" and the site draws its own rabbit illustration.
        When you have a real photo, put the file next to index.html and
        write  photo:  "photos/clover.jpg"

   ── REPLACING A "COMING SOON" SLOT ──
      Every rabbit currently lists five placeholder frames after its real
      photo, so the card opens a photo view with the shots still to come.
      When you take one, do two things:

        1. Put the file next to index.html in the photos folder, named
           after the rabbit and the shot:  photos/teddy-hands.jpg
           (Your phone's date is stripped out when photos travel through
           chat, so I cannot read it off the file. Type it in yourself.)
        2. In that rabbit's photos list, swap the placeholder line's src
           for yours and add the date you took it:

             { src: "photos/teddy-hands.jpg", date: "2026-09-02",
               note: "In my hands, so you can see how big she really is." }

      Dated photos sort oldest first and the undated placeholders drop to
      the end by themselves, so the set always reads as the rabbit growing
      up with the gaps trailing behind. When the last placeholder is gone,
      delete nothing else. It just works.

      A NOTE ON THE COUNTER: the little badge on each card counts frames,
      so today it says 6 when only one is a real photograph. Anyone who
      taps it finds five Coming soon cards. That is a promise the page is
      making on your behalf, so the sooner those slots are filled the
      better. Five photos of four rabbits is about twenty minutes.

   ── ADDING MORE THAN ONE PHOTO ──
      Add a photos: [ ] list and the card becomes tappable: it opens a
      bigger view with all of them, dates included. Two or more photos
      turns it on by itself. One photo or none and nothing changes.

        photos: [
          { src: "photos/clover-1.jpg", date: "2026-08-05" },
          { src: "photos/clover-2.jpg", date: "2026-08-19", note: "First time out on the rug" }
        ],

      THE DATE IS WORTH FILLING IN. Whatever date you put on a photo gets
      stamped in the corner of that photo along with how old the rabbit was
      that day, worked out from its dob. So "date: 2026-08-24" on a rabbit
      born 28 July shows as

          24 Aug 2026 · 3 weeks, 6 days old

      A photo with no date falls back to "Born 28 Jul 2026", which is still
      true but says less. Nobody has to count weeks on their fingers, and
      the growing-up sequence explains itself.

      date is optional, note is optional. Dates show as "5 Aug" under
      the photo, and the list is sorted oldest first so it reads as the
      rabbit growing up.

      HOW MANY: five or six. Not because more angles are more charming,
      but because each photo should retire one question a person would
      otherwise have to ask you, or decide on without an answer. Once the
      questions are answered, another photo is just another slow thing on
      the page.

      Baymard Institute's usability testing is the source worth trusting
      here: 56% of people start exploring the images the moment a product
      page loads, before they read anything, and only about 25% of shops
      give them enough to decide on. Underphotographing is the common
      failure, not overphotographing.

      WHAT TO SHOOT — each of these does a job:
        1. Face on, eyes visible. This is the one that stops the scroll.
        2. Full body from the side, standing. Shape, proportion, coat.
        3. In someone's hands. Scale. "How big is this actually" is the
           question people are worst at answering from a photo alone.
        4. Ears and head close up. For a Holland Lop this is the breed
           trait people are buying, and yours are still setting.
        5. Doing something ordinary -- eating, mid-hop, sitting in the
           run. Temperament reads from behaviour, never from a portrait.
        6. Optional: alongside a littermate, for colour comparison.

      Even light, plain background, and shoot at the rabbit's eye level
      rather than from standing height. Down-angled phone photos make any
      animal look smaller and further away.

      Photograph what is actually there. Your own FAQ offers a refund if a
      rabbit is not as described, so a flattering photo is a refund you
      pay for later, plus a person who tells people about it.

   ── THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK THIS ──
      Every line inside a { } block ends with a comma, except the last.
      Every block ends with },
      Keep the "quotes" around text. Numbers like price have no quotes.
      If the rabbits disappear from your site, you deleted a bracket.
      Undo the change in GitHub and it comes straight back.
